# Unitree_h1_humanoid-gym（Unitree H1 Robot Walking Application）
An implement of unitree_h1 robot with humanoid-gym, this repository contains an application for controlling the Unitree H1 robot using the Humanoid-Gym environment. The goal of this project is to implement walking capabilities for the Unitree H1 robot, utilizing reinforcement learning techniques to enhance its mobility and stability.

## Overview

The Unitree H1 is a versatile quadruped robot designed for various applications, including research, development, and education. By integrating with the Humanoid-Gym framework, we aim to create a robust walking algorithm that allows the robot to navigate complex terrains and perform dynamic movements.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilizes reinforcement learning algorithms for training the robot.
- **Simulation Environment**: Integrated with Humanoid-Gym for realistic simulation and testing. More informention for Humanoid-Gym https://github.com/roboterax/humanoid-gym.
- **Real-time Control**: Implements real-time control strategies for smooth and stable walking.
- **Video Demonstration**: See the walking capabilities in action!
